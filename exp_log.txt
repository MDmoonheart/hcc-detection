specify the input of first convolution layer so that the model can accept image with 1 channel.

filter the void mask and corresponding images(all pixel value is zero). Since, we only have roughly 2000 
filtred images with label, we might need to do some augmentation on these images.

create data pipeline and factorize it into tf.dataset, then split it into training sets, validation set and test sets.

Finish building the pipeline and start training model. model training fails because of the excess of memory. 
Reducing the batch size will solve the problem but still cannot start the first epoch on windows 10 server with 
no GPU. Planing to train the model on the other machine or rebuild datset by copying the target files into the 
working directory.

The trainig process cannot start becasue of the limit of CPU even I convert data type from float64 to float 16, I decide to split the data
generation process from from the training process. I will first read the dicom data and transfer it into a data directory for build 
tensorflow datasets. The processsing of the images is totally invisible to outsiders.
